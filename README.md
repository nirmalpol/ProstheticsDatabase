Software Bugs/Defects:
- Unable to rotate/pan files in Safari but can zoom in and out; updates correctly; download correctly
- On Windows, view slightly shifts based on whether a side scrollbar is present or not


Others:
- Users may be confused that canvas does not update unless ‘Submit’ is explicitly pressed again 
- Users may like to directly change certain dimensions of the file for their needs
